### Step 3: Add Code to `functions.php` in the Child Theme

To enable the multi-step functionality, add the given function.php file code to your child theme’s `functions.php` file.

### Step 4: Customize and Style

Once you’ve set up the basic multi-step functionality, you can further customize the design and layout to fit your theme. Here are a few customization tips:

1. **Adjust HTML Structure**: Modify the `form-checkout.php` file in your child theme to rearrange fields or sections as needed. Each step can be wrapped in `<section>` or `<div>` tags to make navigation easier with JavaScript.

2. **CSS Styling**: Add CSS in your child theme’s stylesheet or directly within the `functions.php` code provided to match your website’s look and feel.
